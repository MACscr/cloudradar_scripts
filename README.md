# cloudradar_scripts
Set of scripts and notifier for custom CloudRadar.io checks. Existing features and scripts could not be found, so took my own stab at making a few of them. Use at your own risk as this is my first stab at any python coding. You might have to install python requests support. On a Debian 10 system, I had to to run the following:

```bash
apt-get install python-requests
```
